# 2-Player Tanks War Game

This is a 2-player tanks war game developed using OpenGL and Pygame. Players control tanks on opposite sides of the screen and take turns to shoot at each other. The game features animated tank movement, shooting mechanics, health bars, and sound effects.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay with alternating turns
- Animated tank movement and shooting
- Health bars for each tank
- Sound effects for shooting and game events
- Start screen and game-over screens
- Interactive controls with keyboard and mouse

## Controls

- **Move Left Tank:** `A` to move left, `D` to move right
- **Move Right Tank:** Arrow keys to move left and right
- **Aim Gun:** Move the mouse to aim the gun
- **Shoot:** Left mouse button
- **Start Game:** `P`
- **About Screen:** `A` (only from start screen)
- **Return to Start Screen:** `R` (only from about screen)
- **Restart Game:** `Y` (only from game over screen)
- **Exit Game:** `N` (only from game over screen)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Pygame and PyOpenGL**:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame PyOpenGL
    ```

2. **Run the Game**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Files and Directories

- **main.py**: The main script containing the game logic
- **/imgs/**: Directory containing the images for tanks, background, and UI elements
- **/sounds/**: Directory containing the sound effects

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing `main.py`.
2. Press `P` to start the game.
3. Use the keyboard and mouse to control your tank and shoot at your opponent.
4. The game ends when one tank's health bar is depleted. The winner is announced on the game-over screen.
5. Press `Y` to restart the game or `N` to exit.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and skills in the following areas:

- **Game Development with Pygame and OpenGL**: Understanding the basics of game development, including rendering graphics, handling user input, and implementing game logic.
- **Animation and Physics**: Implementing animated movements and shooting mechanics, and understanding basic physics principles for collision detection and response.
- **Sound Integration**: Adding sound effects to enhance the gaming experience, including shooting sounds and game event notifications.
- **User Interface Design**: Creating intuitive start, about, and game-over screens, and implementing health bars to display game status.
- **Problem-Solving and Debugging**: Identifying and fixing bugs, optimizing game performance, and improving gameplay experience through iterative testing and refinement.
- **Collaboration and Project Management**: Working with version control systems, managing project files and directories, and documenting the project for future reference.
